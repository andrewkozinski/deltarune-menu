# Deltarune Main Menu Recreation

This is a site I made as a fun side project that aims to recreate the Deltarune main menu from both Chapter 1 and what the main menu looks like when you complete either Chapter 1 or 2. The project includes a toggle switch in the bottom right corner that allows a user to change from chapter 1's main menu to the appearance the main menu takes upon a chapter's completion. This project features music and sound effects from Deltarune and was made using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
